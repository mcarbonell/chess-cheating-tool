orientation

'white' or
'black'
	

'white'
	

If provided, sets the initial orientation of the board.

Boolean
	

true
	

Turn board notation on or off.
	

Notation

sparePieces

Boolean
	

false
	

If true, the board will have spare pieces that can be dropped onto the board.

If sparePieces is set to true, draggable gets set to true as well.
	

Spare Pieces

showErrors

false or
String or
Function
	

n/a
	

showErrors is an optional parameter to control how Chessboard reports errors.

Every error in Chessboard has a unique code to help diagnose problems and search for solutions.

If showErrors is false then errors will be ignored.

If showErrors is 'console' then errors will be sent to console.log().

If showErrors is 'alert' then errors will be sent to window.alert().

If showErrors is a function then the first argument is the unique error code, the second argument is an error string, and an optional third argument is a data structure that is relevant to the error.
	

pieceTheme

String or
Function
	

'img/chesspieces/
wikipedia/{piece}.png'
	

A template string used to determine the source of piece images.

If pieceTheme is a function the first argument is the piece code.

The function should return an <img> source.
	

Piece Theme String

Set Position
Position Object

You can use a JavaScript object to represent a board position.

The object property names must be algebraic squares (ie: e4, b2, c6, etc) and the values must be a valid piece codes (ie: wP, bK, wQ, etc).

See an example of using an object to represent a position here.

Chessboard.js exposes the Chessboard.objToFen method to help convert between Position Objects and FEN Strings.
FEN String

You can use Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) to represent a board position.

Note that FEN notation captures more information than chessboard.js requires, like who's move it is and whether or not castling is allowed. This information will be ignored; only the position information is used.

See an example of using a FEN String to represent a position here and here.

Chessboard.js exposes the Chessboard.fenToObj method to help convert a FEN String to a Position Object.
Errors

Chessboard.js has an error system designed to inform you when you use the API incorrectly.

Every alert has a unique code associated with it and you can control how the errors are presented with the showErrors config option.
